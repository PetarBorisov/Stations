In this project, I have written code that aims to accept a certain number of objects in the form of a JSON file, import them into a local database, then select certain parameters from the entire database and visualize them. More specifically, we are talking about gas stations that have several parameters, among which are the price of diesel fuel, the price of gasoline type e5 and gasoline type 10. The goal of the project is to show the lowest, highest and average prices of the types of fuels . The project was created with Java and the framework is Spring, for the front-end part I used HTML and CSS, as for the tool that connects the backend with the frontend part I used Timeleaf. For the database I used MySQL. After starting the project (in Localhost8080), a start page with one button is displayed, which leads to a data import page, on which there is an import button, if the import fails, the page does not change, and if successful, it takes you to the next page, which ensures that the data is imported, on the page for a successful import there is a button to display the fuel price statistics, after pressing the button, if successful, the last page with the unvisited statistics is displayed.
